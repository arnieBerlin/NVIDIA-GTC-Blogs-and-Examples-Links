April 11, 2021.

These links to examples and a blog accompany the presentation I recorded for Nvidia GTC 2021

Scale Your Deep Learning Research from Desk to Cloud: Implementing Multiple AI Experiments for Head and Neck Tumor Segmentation [S31255]
The recording and pdf can be found here: https://gtc21.event.nvidia.com/media/Scale%20Your%20Deep%20Learning%20Research%20from%20Desk%20to%20Cloud%3A%20Implementing%20Multiple%20AI%20Experiments%20for%20Head%20and%20Neck%20Tumor%20Segmentation%20%5BS31255%5D/1_bxdwvfsp

Links to the example mentioned in the presentation are still undergoing final corporate approval and are expected to be available on the MathWorks GitHub site soon.
I will update this with the link when it becomes available

The Blog is available at https://blogs.mathworks.com/deep-learning/2021/04/12/implementing-multiple-ai-experiments/
